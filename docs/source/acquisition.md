# Acquisition manual
Here are all the necessary steps in order to become an OPT master

## Modalities
There are several ways . Standard and most straightforward way is step and measure scheme. Simply rotate the sample, wait and acquire image while tracking the angular rotation. There are many attempts to speed up the process, increase the . With OPTac you can try some of the faster acquisition schemes too.

### Standard acquisition
Suitable for *in-situ* measurements and highest quality images and reconstructions. After dealing with [corrections](#corrections), reconstruction using FBP leads directly to a desired result

## Corrections
Corrections can be divided into some which can be on the acquisition/preprocessing step and other which are more related to the reconstruction. Preprocessing ones are:
1. [Dark-field correction](#dark-field-correction)
2. [Bright-field correction](#dark-field-correction)



### Dark-field correction

### Bright-field correction

### Hot-pixel correction
